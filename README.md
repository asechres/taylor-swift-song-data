# taylor-swift-song-data
The purpose of this project is to determine whether there are any objective qualities 
of songs by Taylor Swift that can predict the reception of the songs by listeners.

In order to see this I:
- Compiled a ranking of all of Swift's Album songs, using several rankings by different parties.
- Compiled a dictionary with all the songs, their album, lyrics, and other key information.
- Utilized the Spotify API to get listening information on each song.
- Ran several functions to gather information on the lyrics of the songs.
- Performed statistical tests to test for correlation.
- Modeled findings with visuals.
